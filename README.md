This was the first project in the foundations section for The Odin Project or "TOPS" and it was my first web project! It covered the basics of html defining what an element and attribute are and from
there it covered how to begin using html to actually build web pages. Following the lessons, I learned about the index.html file and the "boilerplate" html necessary for it to work. How to link together
the pages with the anchor tag <a> and how to embed images within the project with the image tag <img>. Also covered were the best practices for having an organized file system and how to use git version control to document and incrementally build a project.
