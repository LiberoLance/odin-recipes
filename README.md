This was the first project in the foundations section for The Odin Project or "TOPS" and it was my first web project! It covered the basics of html defining what an element and attribute are and from
there it covered how to begin using html to actually build web pages. Following the lessons, I learned about the index.html file and the "boilerplate" html necessary for it to work. How to link together
the pages with the anchor tag <a> and how to embed images within the project with the image tag <img>. Also covered were the best practices for having a professionally organized file system and how to
use git version control to document and incrementally build a project just like a person would working as a web developer.

I guess the best thing I can say is the sense of pride I had for making this really basic website and putting it online through github. It was a lot of fun and it only took about a month to go through
the lessons and a few days to finish the project which isn't all that impressive. In fact, the project is very much the tip of the iceberg but the way the lessons are laid out, it is easy to see how the 
"flow" of code a little, use git to take a snap shot and save your progress, learn a little more... etc...  can snowball into actually making real websites or making a go at a successful career being a 
developer. I've been looking for something like TOPS for a long time so it is really awesome to have finally found a well structured course that is pro gratis. It reminds me of a quote "If you light a 
lamp for somebody, it will also brighten your path"

Anyway off to the next part of the fundamentals section which covers Cascading Style Sheets, "CSS"
